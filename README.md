  :orange_book: [Documentation](https://openthesia.pages.dev/documentation) :orange_book:

## What can it do :question:
Openthesia includes two main modes, **Midi playback** and **Play mode**.

In the Midi playback mode you can select a midi file to play and choose between just visualizing and listening the note blocks or play along with it.
When playing along the playback will wait for the right note input before going to the next note.
In the Play mode you can visualize midi inputs as rising note blocks and also record them to later export the recording as a midi file.

## Features :star:
- **Fully customizable**: change background and note blocks color, turn on notes glowing effect
- **Midi playback**: play and visualize midi files at different speeds, tempo and notes direction
- **Learning mode**: wait for the right key input before going to the next note
- **Play mode**: visualize midi input realtime and record it to export it as a midi file
- **Hands separation**: differentiate between left and right hand with colors

## What operating systems does it support? :desktop_computer:
As of now Openthesia is only available on Windows devices, support for other platforms isn't currently planned.

## Installation :arrow_down:
Download the latest setup from the [releases](https://github.com/ImAxel0/Openthesia/releases) section and install the program.
